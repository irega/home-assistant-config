code: !secret alarm_code #Code, should consist of one or more digits ie 6482
panic_code: !secret panic_code #[OPTIONAL] Panic Code should consist of one or more digits ie 9876, it needs to be different to your standard alarm code. This enables a special panic mode. This can be used under duress to deactivate the alarm which would appear to the unseeing eye as deactivated however a special attribute [panic_mode] listed under the alarm_control_panel.[identifier] will change to ACTIVE. This status could be used in your automations to send a notification to someone else police/spouse/sibling/neighbour that you are under duress. To deactive this mode arm then disarm your alarm in the usual manner.

# ############# SENSOR GROUPS ########################
# # Sensors in this group tigger the alarm immediately

# #  - binary_sensor.door_window_sensor_158d0001a99eb0

# # Sensors in this group start the clock (pending_time) when tripped before the alarm is activated in 'Away' mode
# delayed:

#   - binary_sensor.door_window_sensor_158d0001a5e1a3

# # Same as notathome but hopefully the title is more self explanatory. Can still use notathome for backwards compatibility
# # Note sensors can exist in more than one group notice top_floor appears in two groups
# homemodeignore:
#   - binary_sensor.door_window_sensor_xxxxxxxxx

# # Use this group to automatically override the warning message on open sensors when setting 'away' mode. (I use this as I have a motion sensor at the front door)
# override:
#   - binary_sensor.door_window_sensor_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# # This group is special and only effects 'perimeter mode'. If perimeter_mode is enabled then any sensor in this group will trigger the alarm immediately if arm perimeter is set. There is no delayed group for this mode (unless requested as a feature of course!)
